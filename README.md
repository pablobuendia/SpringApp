# I can't believe it's Spring!

Example CRUD application. Made with Spring Boot and React

## Description

Basically, it's just a simple CRUD for now with a React front-end. I might add more stuff in the future.

## Installation

Skip this part. You probably won't need to know this (for now). It's just a Spring Boot project.

## Usage

Not much really.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change (and what the hell made you think contributing to this project was a good spend of your time).

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
