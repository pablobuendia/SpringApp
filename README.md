# CRUD App: An app to show the stuff that people should know to do the programs that do stuff

Example web app to show some examples of how the technologies invented by smarter people than me work together.

For now it uses Spring as the main framework. Eventually I'll incoporate more stuff on it.

It uses Spring, possibly an Angular front an a lot of stolen code from books and stuff (not really stolen cause it's on public repositories).

If you managed to read this part, congratulations, you truly have amazing concentration abilities.
